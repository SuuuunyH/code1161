TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
The first week journal
Today is thired March in the year of 2018. This is the first weekend during my college life. In this week I knew a lot of new friends, they came from many different countries and are all very kindful. And the professor full of knowledge and common touch. UNSW just like a big family. I have a good time here. But on the opposite, my English is not very well, so there are also some communication barriers. So in my opinon I need to exercise more. I will work harder and try my best.
