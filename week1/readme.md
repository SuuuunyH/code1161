TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
The first week journal
Today is thired March in the year of 2018. This is the first weekend during my college life. In this week I knew a lot of new friends, they came from many different countries and are all very kindful. And the professor full of knowledge and common touch. UNSW just like a big family. I have a good time here. But on the opposite, my English is not very well, so there are also some communication barriers. So in my opinon I need to exercise more. I will work harder and try my best. In the class of CODE1161 I had learnd how to use the Visual Studio Code and download a lot of softwares. But I also have some queations. First of all, I want to know what I can do by using the visual studio code and how to use it well. Actually, I am just a beginner of coputational design. And then I wish to have a look of the whole system of CS. I love CS I want to learn more in CODE1161I I hope I can be a successful human in the feature so I can take the responsbility of my family.
