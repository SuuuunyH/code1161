TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In this week's study, I learned a lot about the visual studio code. Althought I also do not know how to use visual to make a big programme, such as the games. But in this class I learned some Shortcuts F5 can test my works. And how to use the function in the visual. But I knew there are all very simple in the python3. I think I need to learn more in another way. It is not easy for me because there are some terms in the course which I can not understand easily. In the tutorial, it is difficult to ask questions because the teachers are all very busy. Actually, I have some questions about exercise2, when I imput the word, there are nothing happened. I have no idea about it.
